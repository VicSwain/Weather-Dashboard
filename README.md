# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This is a weather app designed for a user to search any city and get the current weather as well as a 5 day forcast. As the user searches more cities, the most recent search will appear unter the search bar, where the user can click that city to return to its forecast. The purpose of this project is to better understand the use of server side API, fetching the information, and allowing the user to view said information. This exercise gave a better understanding of the .then promise and how to pass information between functions. I encounted difficulty in formatting the date information, and have a better understading of day.js and how to use in this scenario. 

### Usage
